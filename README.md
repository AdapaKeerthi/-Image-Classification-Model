# Image Classification Model
This project builds a CNN with PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset — a well-known benchmark with 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (airplane, dog, car, etc.).
- Build and train a CNN
- Track performance (loss & accuracy)
- Evaluate results
- Visualize predictions

  ✅ Training Visualization: Accuracy plotted over epochs   
# Techniques Used
                            
 - Convolution Layers: Automatically learn visual features 
 - ReLU Activation: Non-linearity for deep networks     
 - MaxPooling: Downsampling to reduce complexity   
 - Dropout: Regularization                      
 - Flatten + FC Layers: Classification logic                
 - Adam Optimizer: Efficient gradient descent          
 - CrossEntropyLoss: For multi-class classification      
 - Normalization: Improves convergence speed
